I was a research assistant in the School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, advised by [Dr. Clint Chin Pang Ho](https://guodonglong.github.io/) and [Dr. Zhi Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/z-chen/home), working on safe reinforcement learning, specifically, robust MDP and data-driven optimization. 

I was a student from the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, UK), pursuing a master's degree in Operational Research with Data Science, and fortunately to be advised by [Dr. Emre Alper YILDIRIM](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~yildirim/index.html). Before that, I got a master's degree from Chongqing University (Chongqing, China), focusing on machine learning & time series analysis & power systems.

I am working as a remote research assistant with [A/Prof. Guodong Long](https://guodonglong.github.io/) and [Dr. Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/) on reinforcement learning + X (e.g., federated learning, natural language processing). Before that, 

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. 

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one]
