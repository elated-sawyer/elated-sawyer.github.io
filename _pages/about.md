I am currently a research assistant in the School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, working with [Dr. Clint Chin Pang Ho](https://sites.google.com/view/clint-chin-pang-ho/home) and [Dr. Zhi Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/z-chen/home) on some interesting problems in Safe Reinforcement Learning, specifically, Robust MDP and Data-Driven Optimization. 

I was a student from the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, UK), pursuing a master's degree in Operational Research with Data Science, and fortunately to be advised by [Dr. Emre Alper YILDIRIM](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~yildirim/index.html). Before that, I got a master's degree from Chongqing University (Chongqing, China), focusing on the application of machine learning techniques in renewable energy, and worked as an intern in the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China) for half a year.

*Research interests*: Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining, Robust Optimization, Optimization Algorithm, Convex and Nonconvex Optimization, Time Series Analysis and Renewable Energy.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. 

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one]
